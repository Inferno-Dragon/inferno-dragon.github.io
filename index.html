</H3>About Me</H3>
<p>
Hi I am a young and upcoming professional who has a passion for life and coding I worked in various industries mainly the automotive industry.
Computer systems and software are a passion that I want to pursue further. From a young age I was always intrigued by how diferent componentes work 
together to create a program. In the automotive industry there are alot of safety critical systems that rely on software. I like to challenge myself 
in every aspect of life. I love learning new things I have always had a  passion for technology from a young age I was intrigued by computers and how they 
work and function. From a young age I built my first gaming computer what intrigued me most was the inner workings of the games what code was involvolved 
in making the character move shoot and so forth. I have a passion for learning since I could remember I was intrigued by everything around me how everything
works and the history of technology from how the culture of Ancient Civilisations from the Egytians, Greeks, ancient China and the Romans how they shaped the 
world from the Culture Philoshopy and technological advancements and how they shape our lives today as we know it in the world we live in one of my role 
models is the Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer Archimedes.I was always a person who excelled with every challenge that 
comes my way. I will not stop learing until the day I die. One of the most important things history has thought me is that to every problem there is a solution
and a way to overcome it.I would like to further my skills and knowledge and delve deeper into coding.I also have a passion for animals and for the 
conservation of their natural habitats.
